# Banner Priorities #

Every banner's priority is defined visually. The banner on top in the paddock has the highest priority. Banners that don't have any padding between them have equal priority. Banners with padding between them have different priority.

You can drag and drop banners within the same or different paddocks. Setting priorities is as easy as dropping banners with or without padding between them.

Thus the banner at the bottom of a paddock has always the lowest priority and so it is the default one.

The process of selecting the right banner for an ad place can be presented as a funnel. Banners on top are considered first. If they don't match the request the next banner is considered. The banner at the bottom should not have any limitations (targeting, end date, capping) if you want to display it as the default banner.
