# Targeting By URL #

URL is the URL where ads are served to. So when you put your ad tag on a page the URL of this page is the URL you can target by.

This can be valuable if you are using some CMS and your ad tags are inserted into the main template. The pages are different only in URL. Eg. URLs may contain page id or section id.

You can target ads to different pages using URL targeting.

Another option would creating a separate ad place for each page but sometimes you might have hundreds of different pages and creating ad places for each of them is not practical.
