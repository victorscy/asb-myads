# Targeting By Referrer #

What is a referrer?

When a web surfer lands on a page with ads served by ASB MyAds, referrer is the URL from which the web surfer was directed to your page.

For example: user clicks on your Google Ad Words PPC text ad in Google search results and lands on your home page with banners served by ASB MyAds. Referrer is the URL with Google search results and where the click occurred that redirected the user to your site. Obviously this referrer URL contains searched keywords.

So targeting by referrer is a very valuable feature. You can target users by traffic sources as they are listed in your Google Analytics report.
